== What is it?

*AjaxAnywhere* is an *Open Source* Java Ajax framework that enables the
developer to **add Ajax behaviour to your web application adding simple
markup and without any Javascript coding**. This library is a fork of
the ancient and abandoned
http://ajaxanywhere.sourceforge.net/[AjaxAnywhere] library hosted in
SourceForge but with the following improvements:

* *The developer does not need to write any Javascript code.* You just
need to include the AjaxAnywhere Javascript file in your page and it
will do the rest for you!!
* AjaxAnywhere Javascript file now *relies on jQuery* to implement all
the required features.
* Code base has been simplified and a dependency with the Java SE HTML
parser has been removed.
* JSF support has been dropped. +

AjaxAnywhere continues to be a *page or page fragment oriented
framework* and not a component framework. So donâ€™t expect to find ``yet
another autocomplete component''.

* https://github.com/jbake-org/jbake-gradle-plugin[JBake plugin for Gradle] is a Gradle plugin which makes it very easy to render http://jbake.org[JBake] site directly from http://www.gradle.org[Gradle]. A full description of the process can be found in link:/blog/2014/02/hosting-jbake-github.html[this post].
* https://github.com/melix/groovy-bytecode-ast[A @Bytecode AST transformation for Groovy]. This one is an experiment I made, which allows writing bytecode directly in a Groovy method body. Not safe for work :-)
* https://github.com/melix/asm-bytecode-intellij[An ASM bytecode plugin for IntelliJ]. This plugin adds a bytecode tool window to IntelliJ, with various options for viewing the bytecode of a Java class, including ASMified and Groovified.

And a lot more... just take a look at my https://github.com/melix[GitHub profile].
